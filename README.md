About Me

I earned my MSc in Management and Business Analytics, but my true passion lies in the dynamic intersection of business, technology, and creativity. I call myself a digital business analyst because I love to weave together these diverse areas to help businesses thrive in the ever-evolving digital landscape.

Think of me as your digital sherpa, guiding you through the mountains of data, streamlining processes, and crafting compelling narratives that resonate with your audience. When I'm not working my magic, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, creating engaging content, or connecting with fellow digital enthusiasts.
